# Operators In Python :

# Arithmetic Operator:
# a = 5
# b = 2
# print("The value of a is :",a)
# print("The value of b is :",b)
# print("Addition is :", a+b)
# print("Substraction is :",a-b)
# print("Multiplication is :",a*b)
# print("Division is :",a/b)
# print("floor Division is :",a//b)
# print("Reminder is :",a%b)
# print("a raise to the power b :",a**b)

# Assignment Operator :
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x += 5
# print(x)
# x -= 5
# print(x)
# x /= 5
# print(x)

# Comparison Operator :
# i = 5
# # print(i==8)
# # print(i!=8)
# # print(i>8)
# # print(i<8)
# # print(i<=8)
# # print(i>=8)

# Logical Operatoor
# a = True
# b = False
#
# print("and Operator :")
# print("True and True :",a and a)
# print("True and False :",a & b)
# print("False and True :",b & a)
# print("False and False :",b & b)
#
# print("\nor Operator :")
# print("True or True :",a or a)
# print("True or False :",a | b)
# print("False or True :",b | a)
# print("False or False :",b | b)

# identity Operator :
# a = 5
# b = 10
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)

# Membership Operators :
# list = [12, 9, 62, 56, 38, 9, 59]
# print("10 in list :",10 in list)
#
# print("10 not in list :",10 not in list)

# Bitwise Operator :
# # 0 - 00
# # 1 - 01
# # 2 - 10
# # 3 - 11
# print("and Operator :",0 & 1)
# #     00
# # &
# #     01
# # ____________
# #     00 - 0
# print("or Operator :",0 | 3)
# #     00
# # |
# #     11
# # ____________
# #     11 - 3
